## üíª Installation

To set up **GradeWiz-JavaSE** on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TechAngelX/GradeWiz-JavaSE.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   Change to the project directory where the `src` folder is located. Let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs located at `/GradeWiz-JavaSE`:

    ```bash
    cd GradeWiz-JavaSE
    ```

3. **Compile the Code**:

   Use the `javac` command to compile the Java source files. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and `javac` is available in your PATH:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p bin
    javac -d bin src/**/*.java
    ```

   This command compiles all `.java` files from the `src` directory and outputs the compiled `.class` files into the `bin` directory.

4. **Run the Application**:

   After compilation, use the `java` command to run the main application class. Replace `com.techangelx.gradeWiz.Main` with the fully qualified name of your main class:

    ```bash
    java -cp bin com.techangelx.gradeWiz.Main
    ```

   This command starts the application, allowing you to interact with it through the command line or graphical interface.
